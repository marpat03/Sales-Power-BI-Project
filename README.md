# Sales-Power-BI-Project

## Problem Statement:
"You are tasked with creating a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for ABC Company using their sales data from the last three years. This dashboard should provide insights into sales performance, customer coverage, and target analysis, among other key metrics."

---

This repository's objective is to utilise exploratory data analysis (EDA) to merge, clean, and transform 5 Excel sheets to make one comprehensive table, which outlines sales performance of the ABC company in USA. This project has been implemented using Python on Google Colab and Power BI to visualise my findings.

## Project Objective:
The objective of this project was to clean, organise, analyse, and visualise the sales performance of a hypothetical (ABC) company on an interactive dashboard. The intended outcome was to provide actionable insights into salesperson performance, product sales, customer distribution, and revenue distribution between 2017-2019. This is to ensure efficient business strategies can be implemented to optimise sales within Washington, USA.

## Key Insights: 

1. Sahil Seymour generated the most sales by revenue ($4.7 million), selling around 9.4k units. Meanwhile, Shakil Durham sold the most products (10.0k units) and generated $3.3 million. Seymour and Durham are exceptional salespeople, with both exceeding their annual target in 2018: Seymor exceeded by 56.83% and Durham exceeded by 58.49%. Their performance greatly reflects on their supervisors' performance as well; Sarah-Jayne Pennington (Seymour's supervisor) and Tahmina Vinson (Durham's supervisor) have the best performance in number of sales and revenue generated. 
   
2. In contrast, the low performining salesperson are: Ayaana Mackenzie, Lorenzo Donovan, and Serenity Rich; they are 'significantly below target', meaning their actual sales is under 50% of what is expected of them. They may need re-training or put under a new supervisor in order to improve their performance.
   
3. 2018 is the strongest selling year, having a 53.6% increase from the previous year ($6.6 million to $10.2 million). Trends show that the Q3 and Q4 are the strongest quarters in the year, with wheat flour, yeast, oils, and flours consistently dominating in revenue and units sold. This may be due to wheat flours, flours, and yeast having a significant decrease in average unit prices between 2017 and 2018. In contrast,drink products (e.g. red dry wine, coffee, and energy drinks) have experienced moderate-significant increases and thus have not sold as well. 
   
4. Food is responsible for ~90% of the total sales while drinks accounts for ~10%.
   
5. The city of Yoman in WA generates the highest revenue, followed by Winthrop (32% lower than Yoman) and Roslyn (2.3% lower than Winthrop). While Roslyn and Winthrop are strong competitors, Roslyn shares the same primary produce as Yoman -- wheat flours -- but generate lower sales. This indicates that Roslyn may be an untapped potential in that department. Additionally, Winthrop could be a valuable growth opportunity for marketing drinks as their primary produce is sugarcane liquor.
   
6. 2019 is an unfinished year for the company, but has already shown a promising start. Despite having the highest revenue for January and February alone, the overall revenue is still lower compared to 2018's January-February performance.
