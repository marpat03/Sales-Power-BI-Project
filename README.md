# Sales-Power-BI-Project

## Problem Statement:
"You are tasked with creating a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for ABC Company using their sales data from the last three years. This dashboard should provide insights into sales performance, customer coverage, and target analysis, among other key metrics."

---

This repository's objective is to utilise exploratory data analysis (EDA) to merge, clean, and transform 5 Excel sheets to make one comprehensive table, which outlines sales performance of the ABC company in USA. This project has been implemented using Python on Google Colab and Power BI to visualise my findings.

## Project Objective:
The objective of this project was to clean, organise, analyse, and visualise the sales performance of a hypothetical (ABC) company on an interactive dashboard. The intended outcome was to provide actionable insights into salesperson performance, product sales, customer distribution, and revenue distribution between 2017-2019. This is to ensure efficient business strategies can be implemented to optimise sales within Washington, USA.

## Key Insights: 

1. Sahil Seymour generated the most sales by revenue ($4.7 million), selling around 9.4k units. Meanwhile, Shakil Durham sold the most products (10.0k units) and generated $3.3 million. Seymour and Durham are exceptional salespeople, with both exceeding their annual target in 2018: Seymor exceeded by 56.83% and Durham exceeded by 58.49%.
   
2. In contrast, the low performining salesperson are: Ayaana Mackenzie, Lorenzo Donovan, and Serenity Rich; they are 'significantly below target', meaning their actual sales is under 50% of what is expected of them.
   
3. 2018 is the strongest selling year, having a 53.6% increase from the previous year ($6.6 million to $10.2 million). Trends show that the Q3 and Q4 are the strongest quarters in the year, with wheat flour, yeast, oils, and flours consistently dominating in revenue and units sold. Popcorn is one of the highest selling products, but it does not generate as much revenue as the aforementioned products.
